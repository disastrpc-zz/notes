# The Process of Vulnerability Scanning

## Understanding the scanning proccess

Most automated vulnerability scanners follow a certain workflow when performing scans, which can go as follows:

1- Detect if target is up and running
2- Conduct or partial port scan
3- Identify the OS using techniques such as fingerprinting
4- Attempt to identify running services using banner grabbing or file discovery
5- Execute a signature matching process to discover vulnerabilities

As a part of the signature-matching process, many scanners use banner grabbing, a simple technique where text strings generated during an initial interaction with an application are obtained
and analyzed. Some applications generate very specific banners, such as OpenSSH, which may return “SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_7.9p1 Debian-10”, allowing us to precisely pinpoint the application
version, while others, such as Apache Tomcat versions 4.1.x to 8.0.x, return a generic HTTP header of “Apache-Coyote/1.1”. Naturally, more specific headers and banners make it easier for the scanner to determine the application version and by extension, to accurately detect potential vulnerabilities.

## Internet Scanning vs Internal Scanning

Vulnerability scanners can easily scan Internet-connected targets as well as those connected to a local network. However, our scan results may be incomplete or inaccurate if we treat these targets as equals. Our network placement in relation to the target can affect our speed threshold, access rights, likelihood of traffic interference, and target visibility.

We need to take the time to thoroughly understand the target network, the exact network location we will be operating from, and the target access our network positioning provides.
