# Vulnerability Scanning with Nmap

 While NSE is not a full-fledged vulnerability scanner, it does have a respectable library of scripts that can be used to detect and validate vulnerabilities. NSE scripts are written in Lua236 and range in functionality from brute force and authentication to detecting and exploiting vulnerabilities. For these purposes we will focus on the scripts in the “vuln” and “exploit” categories, as the former detects a vulnerability and the latter attempts to exploit it.
