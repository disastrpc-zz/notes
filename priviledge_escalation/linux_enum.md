## System Architecture

|**Command**|**Description**|
|:----------|:--------------|
|uname -a|The **uname** command reports basic information about a computer's software and hardware.|
|cat /etc/issue|The file **/etc/issue** is a text file which contains a message or system identification to be printed before the login prompt.|
|cat /etc/*-release|**/etc/lsb-release**, **/etc/redhat-release** files contain a description line which is parsed to get information. ex: "Distributor release x.x (Codename)"|
|cat /proc/version|**/proc/version** specifies the version of the Linux kernel, the version of gcc used to compile the kernel, and the time of kernel compilation. It also contains the kernel compiler's user name.|
|cat /proc/sys/kernel/version|The files in **/proc/sys/kernel/** can be used to tune and monitor miscellaneous and general things in the operation of the Linux kernel. [**Kernel - Documentation**](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/sysctl/kernel.txt)|


## Processes

|**Command**|**Description**|
|:----------|:--------------|
|ps -ef<BR>ps aux|**ps** can report a snapshot of the current processes.|
|top|**top** command displays processor activity of your Linux box and also displays tasks managed by kernel in real-time. It'll show processor and memory are being used and other information like running processes.|
|ls -al /proc/|**/proc** is very special in that it is also a virtual filesystem. It's sometimes referred to as a process information pseudo-file system. It doesn't contain 'real' files but runtime system information (e.g. system memory, devices mounted, hardware configuration, etc). |

|cat ~/.ssh/identity.pub|The file **identity.pub** contains your public key, which can be added to other system's authorized keys files. |
|cat ~/.ssh/identity|The ssh client allows you to selects a file from which the identity (private key) for RSA or DSA authentication is read.|
